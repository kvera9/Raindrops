Raindrops
=========

**Raindrops Game!**

*In this fun game, catch rain drops before they hit the bottom!*

*You get points as you catch the raindrops with a blue llipse that's guided by the position of your mouse! Catch as many as you can for as long as you possible! As you catch more raindrops, more will begin falling*



*Press "S" to Start the game*

*Press "R" to restart, if you'd live to play again once the game is over :) !*

*Click the mouse if you'd like to pause the game!*



*You only have 5 lives, so be careful not to let more than 5 raindrops hit the bottom of the screen or it's game over!!!*




Note to Ms. Gerstein:
I was still unable to upload a single picture as my Catcher. No matter what umbrella, or bucket, etc I uploaded processing would refuse to run the game and kept insisting there were errors and that the picture was unavailble. I published a complaint/bug/glitches in Github, but I simpl wanted to remind you considering it cold affect my grade. Thank You.
